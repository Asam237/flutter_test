### Folder Structure
Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides.

```
flutter-app/
|- android
|- build
|- ios
|- lib
|- test
```

Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project

```
lib/
|- api/
|- commons/
|- langs/
|- views/
|- main.dart
```

Now, lets dive into the lib folder which has the main code for the application.

```
1- api - The api folder allows us to interoperate and consume elements coming from the backend.
2- commons - Contains all the elements common to the application, such as colors, size etc. 
3- langs - Contains all the hard texts of the application.
3- views - contains everything that is visual (screen and component). 
8- main.dart - This is the starting point of the application. 
```
